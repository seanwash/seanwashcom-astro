# Sean Washington

Welcome! I'm a software developer based out of 🏝 [Santa Cruz, CA](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Santa+Cruz,+CA/@36.9759548,-122.0824993,13z). I've been building software since early 2012, with the bulk of my experience being on the web platform. I'm currently building tools to empower interior designers, both big and small, at [SideDoor](https://onsidedoor.com).

Before SideDoor, I co-hosted the [Does Not Compute Podcast](https://spec.fm/podcasts/does-not-compute), built (the now-defunct) [Design Kollective](https://designkollective.com), and was an Engineering Lead at [MetaLab](https://metalab.com).

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/seanwashbot) and [GitHub](https://github.com/seanwash).
